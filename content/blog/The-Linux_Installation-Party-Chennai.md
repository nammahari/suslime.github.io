### The Linux Installation Party

#### FOSS United Chennai.

> **29th July 2023 — Pickyourtrail,Chennai**

👋 வணக்கம் சென்னை,I’ll take you on a wild voyage through the [FOSS United Chennai’s](http://fossunited.org/chennai) amazing Linux Installation Party. Be prepared for a tale of stubborn volunteers, unexpected location changes, and GitHub heroes! 🚀👩‍💻

It all started with great hopes and 30 excited registrants keen to begin their Linux adventure. We had no idea that a last-minute venue change would put our planning skills to the test. But, as the saying goes, where there’s a will, there’s a way! 💪🗺️ We managed to roll with the punches and keep the event going with determination in our hearts.

The participants started to arrive, and their enthusiasm was contagious right away! Starting with experimenting inside a virtual machine, we began with an interesting presentation about the wonders of Linux. As we dug into the Linux installation procedure, exposing the power and freedom this OS gives, the room was buzzing with excitement. 🎉💻🐧

Guess what, too? Our efforts were successful! Right there at the event, one courageous soul made the move to Linux! 🎉 Everyone celebrated their victory at the time, which demonstrated that Linux can win people over one installation at a time.

But we didn’t stop there; we wanted everyone to experience the magic of Linux in the comfort of their homes. Armed with knowledge and enthusiasm, we guided each participant in setting up Linux on their own machines. The joy of empowerment was palpable in the room. 🌟🏡

Next up, the spotlight turned to the world of open-source. We unravelled the mysteries behind the FOSS movement, revealing the power of collaboration and community. Our participants were hungry for more, eager to make their mark in the open-source universe.

And so, the grand moment arrived — their first-ever pull request on [GitHub](http://github.com/fossuchennai)! There’s something extraordinary about witnessing a group of novices turn into GitHub heroes, bravely contributing their code to the world. The sense of accomplishment was immeasurable. 🌐🦸‍♂️

As the day unfolded, we listened intently to the flood of ideas and suggestions pouring in. Although the count of suggestions was modest, the quality was exceptional. Our participant’s creativity sparked a fire within us, igniting the potential for future meetups filled with innovation and excitement. 💡🔥

Did we mention the appreciation swag? Oh yes, we decided to surprise our participants with tokens of recognition. Their smiles lit up the room, and we knew we had achieved something special. 🎁😄

But let’s not forget the magic behind the scenes. Our volunteers were the real champions — creative, resourceful, and masters of interaction. They built a separate group for participants, nurturing a community spirit right from the start. The promotion was electrifying, capturing hearts from their social handles and igniting curiosity all around. ⚡👥

And how could we not mention the design maestros? Their breathtaking creations left everyone impressed and elevated our campaign to new heights. Truly, a picture speaks a thousand words, and their artwork spoke volumes about the brilliance of our event. 🎨👨‍🎨👩‍🎨

Looking back, our journey from low impact to skyrocketing success taught us a valuable lesson — dare to step out of our comfort zone! It’s where the magic happens, where creativity thrives, and where epic events are born.

So, to all the aspiring event organizers out there, take a leap of faith, embrace the unexpected, and remember: laughter and enthusiasm are contagious. Set the stage for an unforgettable experience, and you’ll witness your event soar to unimaginable heights. 🎢🎭🤩

Until next time, keep the FOSS spirit alive and let’s make the world a better place, one Linux installation and GitHub contribution at a time. Happy organizing, and may your events be filled with laughter, learning, and lifelong memories!

best,
nammahari
